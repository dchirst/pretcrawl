The Pret Crawl is a web site for those who frickin' love Pret A Manger.

The site allows users to create their own bespoke *Pret Crawl*, where they travel from A to B visiting Prets along their routes.

Anyone with the Pret Coffee Subscription can get up to 5 drinks a day from any branch, with a 30 minute gap between each one. Therefore, to maximise coffee drinkage on a long walk, they must visit Prets positioned ~30 minutes apart. 

This app makes it easy - simply pick your start and end points, and a patent-pending pret-finding algorithm will select the optimal branches for you to visit.
